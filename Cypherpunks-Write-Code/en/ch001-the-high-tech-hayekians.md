2. Imagine, if you will, sitting down to
your morning coffee, turning on your home
computer to read the day’s newspaper.
Well, it’s not as far fetched as it may seem.
The freedom issues were very important to us.
This is an example of what
you can order through your computer.
It combines the power of your computer
with the convenience of your telephone.
We saw that information technology could create
a 1984 style tyrannical topdown control society
or it could develop into something that
is a decentralized enabler of human freedom.
And even back then, our dream was
to enable the future of human freedom.


3. In the late 1980s, at the dawn of
the online age, a group of young computer
scientists in Silicon Valley started grappling with what
this new technology would mean for society.
We took a look at the potential of computer systems
and thought that for everything about civilization that enables it
to work, we can enable it to work much better.
The most influential figure in what would become
the cypherpunk movement was the physicist Tim May
who envisioned the future Internet as a place
for what he would dubbed crypto anarchy where
lawbreakers, radicals and political dissidents could shield their
activities from government surveillance and control
people doing things that didn’t require permissions from anyone because
the people were untraceable and couldn’t be stopped.
But there was another group that saw
the potential of computers to remake society
gradually from whitin by decentralizing commerce and
improving the dissemination of knowledge.
They were dubbed the High-tech Kayekians because
their worldview was influenced by the work
of Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek.


4. The fundamental insights of Hayekian economics was
how separately formulated plans hand to meshwell.
And we saw electronic media as an
enabler of coordination, of complexity that the
word previously was really not capable of.
The clash of visions between the high tech Heyekians
who wanted to build a borderless frictionless global marketplace
and the crypto anarchists who saw the internet as
a technological means of undermining all governments set the
course for the Cypherpunk movement.
If May was the father of the crypto anarchy,
the central figure for the high-tech kayakians was
the economist and entrepreneur Phil Salin.
Now, if you own a personal computer, we are told, you
can shop at home in what’s called the electronic mall.
It was a few years before the invention of
the World Wide Web, but computer companies were offering
a new type of service in which customers could
connect through their phone lines to post messages to
a bulletin board, check their horoscopes, or go shopping.
You can buy items from department stores ranging from
Nordstrom’s to Neiman Marcus, all via computer screen.
Salon, whose outlook was shaped by his careful

 
5. reading of Hayek, understood that these services weren’t
merely a curiosity or a digital version of
the old mail order catalog.
They were the beginning of something that had
the potential to one day raise national boundaries
through trade and undermine government power.
In a prescient 1991 essay, he foresaw how the Internet would
change the world by 1995, 2000, and beyond.
The static role of store and shopper, seller and
buyer, author and reader, systems defined by their one
way information flows will be replaced by new forms
of media enabling two way information flows.
Before getting involved with computers, Salin had run
a private rocket company and had coauthored a 
congressional study critical of NASA’s wasteful spending.
But in this view, there was continuity between his
interests in space travel and computing, because in both
industries, technology’s purpose was to drive down the transaction
costs that impede human activity, making it feasible to
explore new frontiers and interact in ways that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive. 


6. Now, thanks to breakthroughs in computing, the ability to buy
or obtain exactly the information you need when you want it,
in the form you want it, is about to
explode at a speed unmatched since the invention of printing.
But Salin was foremost an entrepreneur, and in the
mid 1980s, he set out to launch one of
those platforms for buying and selling information.
He called it the American Information Exchange, or Amex
This business that we’re doing is to
make possible a new kind of thing, which is
being able to buy and sell information online.
Amex was a radical idea in the mid 1980s.
Users could buy or sell advice about the real estate
market, writing software or what companies to invest in.
Now, you can say to somebody like Ebay or
like Priceline or like Amazon when we tried to
explain this to people, they simply couldn’t get in.


7. They could not wrap their heads around this.
Some of them, i think, couldn’t
imagine the computational end of it.
Milton Friedman didn’t get it, though it was
similar in ways to the online marketplaces that
would launch a decade later, amex was more
than just an idea before its time.
What set it apart was its grounding and
political philosophy and its lofty goal of elevating
individual decision making over central planning.
It was an instantiation of Austrian economics
now put into code and put online.
Something like this could
have profound human consequences.
And that was the vision.
A fluid, transaction oriented market system with
two way feedback, Salon wrote, would result
in crowding out monolithic, mostly government bureaucracies.
We were laying the philosophical foundations of what is
ecommerce that you can now have creative explosion.
It’s going to change the world.
Yes, that’s right.


8. Intermediating among large populations of human beings
through electronic means results in all kinds
of fascinating emergence and social behavior.
Amex’s chief architect was the pioneering software engineer
Chip Morningstar, who had come from a stint
at George Lucas’s production studio, where he oversaw
the creation of Habitat, which was one of
the first online virtual communities.
After joining Amex, Morningstar coauthored an essay
which argued that in building a world
in software, detailed central planning is impossible.
The world is just more complicated.
People are more complicated.
You cannot know what all their goals are.
What you can do is you can put them into
an environment in which certain kinds of things are possible.
What you can’t do is tell people what they want.
Phil Salin and Mark Miller and Chip
Morningstar’s ideas about how a future internet
could decentralize society inspired Tim May to
first articulate a radically different vision.
May, who would go on to become the most
influential figure in the Cypherpunk movement, was introduced to
Sailing by Morningstar in December of 1987.


9. Chip said, there’s this guy out in Santa
Cruz that you ought to talk to.
As a scientists at Intel, May had solved an 
issue affecting the reliability of the company’s memory chips.
Called the alpha particle problem.
Rich on stock options, he’d been spending his
days at the beach reading science fiction novels,
thinking about how networked personal computers could turn
some of their futuristic scenarios into reality.
So i met with Phil in Redwood
City and he described how amex would work. 
And I said, People aren’t going to
by selling meaningless stuff like surfboard recommendations.
In Mays view, Amex could be useful as
a tool for undermining state power, but only
by shattering legal and social norms.
I said, it’s going to be corporate information.
It’s going to be bomber plans for the B one
bomber who wants to buy that competitor a company.
Who wants to sell that, someone
who has access to that information.
It’s two different types of libertarians.
He didn’t understand the extent to 
which you could benefit the world
by lowering transaction costs for everybody. 

10. Like Salin and the hightech Kayakians,
May saw the personal computer as
enabling technology for sweeping societal changes.
But he had a different vision of a 
virtual marketplace for any and all goods and
services, which he dubbed BlackNet, or a technological
means of undermining all governments.
On Amex, user activity was out in the
open, but black net would be impervious to
government tracking and surveillance, and perhaps t would
be a network with no owners at all.
Many people’s first response would be to say
the black net won’t be allowed to happen.
Perhaps, but technology would
probably make it inevitable.
If you don’t physically meet the person,
if you don’t even know what continent
they’re on, you can’t coerce them.
Tim May is a smart guy.
He was great for honing our ideas and
technologies against, but i think him as sort
of the shock jock for cypherpunks.


11. i want to live in the world that surrounds
us rather than try and construct one from scratch.
We saw this as emerging from inside the 
world and carrying the world along with it.
In 1988, Amex was acquired
by the software giant autodesk.
A growing scene of young technologists came
together around Salin and the high-tech Hayekiani,
all working towards a common vision of
enhancing human freedom through networked personal computing
It was this hot house of ideas
from which a worldview was brilliant.
Salin died of cancer in 1991, the same year
that the World Wide Web became publicly available.
But his intellectual contributions and conflict with May had
laid the groundwork for what would come next for
the cypherpunks the long effort to build a selfsovereign
and anonymous form of digital money and the embrace
of a branch of mathematics called cryptography, which they
come to view as the key to personal liberation on the Internet.

12. The title of the book is
The rise of the computer state.
What i’m saying is the large bureaucracies with
the power that the computer gives them become
more powerful and that they are escaping the
checks and balances of representative democracy.
In 1983, the New York Times reporter David Burnham
warned that the integration of computers into every aspect
of daily life could lead to a level of
automated surveillance unknown in any previous age.
For society to change course, Burnham argued,
citizens would need to rise up through
the democratic process and demand new legal
protections to safeguard their privacy.
There are ways to deal with it.
We have done it, and all i hope is
that we’re on our toes enough and alert enough
to see them and go after them.


13. This is just political jawboning.
A few years later, a physicist named Tim May
argued that putting faith in representative democracy was naive
He believed that only innovation could
save us from the Orwellian state.
The interesting things that had happened
had been technological changes the telephone
copy machine, the VCR, computers.
May became a cofounder of the cypherpunk movement, which
come together around the idea that a recent breakthrough
in the field of cryptography was the key innovation
for combating tyranny, comparable to how the crossbow enabled
individuals to go up against medieval armies.
It’s an epiphany.
It’s like standing on top of the mountain
and seeing that this is out there.
Coming up: reason takes a look at how
one community came to see cryptography as a
powerful weapon for defeating Big Brother.
Here’s part two in a four part series on
how the cypherpunk movement anticipated the promise and the
peril that lay ahead when the Internet upend the world.
