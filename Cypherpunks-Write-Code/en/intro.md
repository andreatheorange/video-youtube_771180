1. Government is not a monolithic
thing which is your enemy.
it’s a multitudinous thing which is your enemy.
our dream was to enable the future of human freedom
in the early 1990s, a group of mathematicians, misfits,
hackers and hobbyists came together around a shared belief
that the internet would either demolish artificial walls or
lay the groundwork for an orwellian state.
We can prevent the Ministry of Truth.
They saw a branch of mathematics called
cryptography as a weapon against central planning
and surveillance in this new virtual world.
And what is a cypherpunk?
Cypherpunks are a cryptography activist.
The more i realized how it was a
really pivotal technology for society, the National Security
Agency declared the unrestrained public discussion on cryptographic
research threatened our national security.
I saw this as the critical fork in 
the road with a future of human freedom.
Coming up, reason presents a forepart series
on a movement that foresaw both the
promise and the peril that lay ahead.
When the Internet upended the world, it’s
like standing on top of the mountain
and saying that this is out there.
You people who are here can say, okay, what
kind of world do we really want to build?
And build it.
