30.  We see a free world that has achieved a
level of prosperity unprecedented in all human history.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.
If you had asked me ten years ago,
is it possible that communism could
collapse by the year 1992
that I would have said, absolutely ridiculous.


31. Fall of the Berlin Wall was important to me because
I thought it was the end of history and that
national borders would cease being the walls of prisons.
And so a couple years later when i discovered the
Internet, I thought, oh, this is part of this pattern
where borders and distance stop being barriers to people.
Then i discovered a whole clan of people
who self-identified as computer people found my tribe.
And among that clan was the cypherpunks mailing list.
If you want to subscribe to our mailing list, send
a blank email message and just say subscribe cypherpunks.
And what is a cypherpunk? What do you guys think?
Cypherpunks are a cryptography activist.
The cypherpunk email list, which started in the fall
of 1992, one year after the launch of the
World Wide Web, became a gathering place for a
global community interested in using cryptography to allow individuals
to communicate and transact on the Internet privately and
without interference from a central authority.


32. In the last 20 years, the basic techniques
to do all sort of impossible seeming things
have suddenly emerged, put them into practice.
Many cypherpunks were inspired by the work of the
computer scientist David Chaum, who had demonstrated that it
was possible to use cryptography to build an anonymous
payment network that ran on the Internet.
Because of the cypherpunks and because of
the science papers of David Chaum.
I thought the third thing that's going to happen
is economic freedom, that people are going to be
no longer constrained by national borders and distance from
cooperating, sharing resources and helping each other.
But at this watershed moment of collapsing borders,
there was a divide within the cypherpunk community
over whether these cryptographic tools would lead to
more individual freedom, free trade and the spread
of democracy or the end of government all together.
The cypherpunk movement's most influential figure was
the physicist and intellectual provocateur Tim May,
who coined the phrase crypto anarchy.


33. He saw the fall of the Berlin Wall as evidence that
the societal institutions we take for granted could collapse in short
order, just as they had in the Middle Ages.
We saw the little principalities, the
monarchies, the religious, the Papal States.
We saw those collapse probably as a result
of publishing, printing
May penned a one page summary
of how cryptography would upend society.
So i just sat down at my little
Machintosh and loosely patterned this after the Communist
Manifesto the specter is haunting the modern world,
the specter of crypto anarchy.
Cryptography is really, really strong.
We can be protected from anything without, from the
observes, from the watchers, from the imposers of the
past upon the future we're trying to create.
May was skeptical of the idea that humanity
was witnessing an unabashed victory of economic and
political liberalism or that it was possible to
overcome tyranny through collective action.


34. Ad the political scientist Francis Fukuyama argued,
we as human being want to be
recognized with a certain dignity.
This is the essential driving force behind democratic
revolutions, whether they take place in Eastern Europe
or in Asia or in Latin America
May embraced a technology based theory of historic change summed
up by the movement's tagline, which was coined
by the mathematician Eric Hughes.
Cypherpunks write code.
What Eric meant by cypherpunks write code is, don't
be one of those guys who goes to a
Libertarian Party conference and sits about getting somebody elected
to the Los Gato City Council.
That way lies madness.
Whereas the interesting things that had
happened had been technological changes the
telephone, copy machines, the VCR.
The philosophy that i really got interested in
is that you don't just go and ask
the regulator, oh, we need more privacy online.
You could fix it.
Arguing and complaining and lobbying and politics have
nominal effect on what changes the world.
Is technology adoption and
society moving, shifting speed points.


35. For crypto anarchists like me, writing code
meant building systems for anonymous transactions on
the internet that made the arbitrary divisions
of the political world irrelevant.
National borders are just speed
bumps on the information superhighway.
Online cryptographic networks would be structured like a geodesic
dome, a form hailed by the countercultural technologists of
the 1970s for being in harmony with nature and
highly resistant to external attack
Networks with no owners, with many interconnecting
nodes that would be basically unstoppable.
In a geodesic market economics will no longer be the
handmaiden of politics, the cypherpunk writer Robert Hettinga
noted, and nation states will eventually be as
ceremonial as modern day constitutional monarchs.
The idea of a many to many
connection was clearly going to happen.
But it was much easier to build a functional
network for cooperation and trade when you can rely
on a central authority to enforce the rules.
How can we use this weird crypto technique
to solve this strange, esoteric little problem that
in the real world, you just solve
because, I know what your Social Security number is, or
you have to have your government issued ID that you
take into the bank so that you can open up
your bank account and they can link the two together
and say, okay, if Jim McCoy walks out on this
100.000$ loan, we know where to find him.


36. I was trying to deal with those problems.
You can buy and sell property in cyberspace
using cryptographic protocols, the idea of ways in
which people might provide the equivalent of what
government does in a decentralized fashion.
Tim stole some ideas from my machinery of
freedom, and he reprocessed them with all this
technological, and then i stole them back.
A function of government that was particularly hard to
replicate using cryptography was the issuance of money.
The cypherpunks attempted to build a borderless
Internet currency system as anonymous as cash,
and that like gold held its value
without the backing of a central bank.
Gold makes very good money because nobody
can manufacture more of it very readily,
put mildly,
right, whereas bits are perfectly copyable, so
turning bits into good money is quite difficult.
Tim May and many others considered electronic cash to
be the Holy Grail because it completed the picture.


37. A private and decentralized monetary system, May
argued, was a key component in constructing
a new borderless world where the activities
and assets of individuals would be resistant
to government control and confiscation.
You don't physically meet the person if you
don't even know what content they're on.
You can't coerce them.
But there was another faction within the
movement that rejected Tim May's vision.
According to a new world in cyberspace,
the High-tech Hayekians were people like Eric
Drexler, Mark Miller, Phil Salin.
They were focused on designing secure computing systems
based on economic insights, particularly those of the
Austrian born Nobel Prize winner Friedrich Hayek.
Instead of building a new virtual world
shielded from government interface, the hi-tech Hayekians
sought to use technology to demolish walls
and divisions within the existing world.
They imagined that introducing new tools for
human coordination would gradually erode the government's
ability to impinge on our freedoms.


38. We did lots and lots of fantasizing about
how the world could be different, but we
saw this as emerging from inside the world.
Cryptography was tool for porting economic
concepts and legal structures onto the Internet,
but the aim was to foster new
forms of P2P commerce and knowledge sharing.
And the hi tech Hayekians believed that even imperfect
systems can transform society gradually from within.
The overall arc of world history is towards
rule of law, towards less corruptible systems.
If the emergence of the world of crypto commerce
creates systems that are vastly less corruptible but
under a whole mix of different mechanisms and
governance regimes such that they're not always everywhere
incorruptible, I think that's fine.


39. There's a lot of power in providing people tools such
that they can successfully start to act more like you
would like them to, as opposed to you've got to
come over here where it's really hard edge encrypted and
it works exactly the way we want.
No, no, let's raise people's levels incrementally
and that's an improvement in the world.
For many cypherpunks, the darker side of crypto
anarchy was epitomized by the writings of a
chemist and electrical engineer, Jim Bell, a participant
on email list who, in the mid
90s, compared aggression by the state to that
of muggers, rapists, robbers and murderers and
posited a cryptographically protected marketplace in which
anonymous individuals could, in effect, pay to
have government employees killed with the goal
of destroying the state.
In 1997, Bell was arrested and went
to prison for, among other things, dropping
a stink bomb on a government building.
Tim May distanced himself from Bell's writings
and activities while maintaining that marketplaces for
assassination like the one Bell had described
might be both inevitable and desirable.


40. Can evil be done with this technology?
Not just the Internet, but especially
the crypto part of it? Yes.
And so what?
So then
Deal with it.
Zimmerman once told me that he sometimes regretted ever introducing
PGP to the world because it could be used by
Al Qaeda or the Taliban or what not.
I say, so what?
I'm not morally responsible would have happened whether we had
existed or not
because technology has its own logic and
people want to do what they want to do.
I mean, they want free shit,
they want freedom to do things.
Even if they say this should be regulated,
they'll often make the conscious decision to copy
music, copy videotapes they want to see
black net is a negative consequence.


41. I'm not interested in creating that.
When you build technology to solve problems, then you create
then there are consequences that we try to think ahead of
and look at and figure out how we might address and
get ahead of the downsides of what we build.
And that's responsible development and
we certainly engaged in that.
And talking with Tim May and putting on that
you know
what if I was a black hat kind of thing was
certainly a useful foil for working through those kinds of
ideas, but that's absolutely not what cypherpunks were.
The progress of the spread of democracy, if
you take a sufficiently long term view of
it, has been really quite remarkable.


42. Our dream was to enable the future of human freedom
and we had this bizarre confidence about how the future
would unfold and to using Alan Cave's famous phrase, to
have a huge hand in inventing it.
But the road had a lot more weeds
and detours that we could have anticipated.
When we first launched, we were
hoping for maybe 400 500 people.
Now we're at 100 thousand people, so
who knows where we're going at.
Using the ever-growing storage capacity of
servers belonging to companies like Google
Instead of being on your server, under your desk.
That stuff is being taken care of for you.
Professionals keep track of all the
programs and the data
… a simpler life.
I find this way of working more simple
You collect half a gigabyte
of information on your customers.
What do you do with that?
They want to know everything about you so
they can sell you stuff and it results
in you each getting a digital proctology exam.
The NSA specifically targets
the communications of everyone.


43. Over the next quarter century, the internet would make
possible an explosion of individual freedom and information sharing,
just as Phil Salin had predicted in 1991.
But it would also grow into a surveillance apparatus that
bore out the dystopian vision of journalist David BurnHam in
his 1983 book the rise of the computer state.
Large bureaucracies with the power that the computer
gives them become more powerful and they are
escaping the checks and balances of representative democracy.
Facebook collects information that the East
German stasi would have killed for.
I think that most people are quite happy
to hand people all of the information about
them online in return for a few pics
of your high school friends, kids or whatever.
By the mid 2000s, it seemed
the cypherpunk movement had mostly failed.
Then came a global financial crisis, followed
by massive bailouts by central banks.


44. On october 31, 2008 a pseudonymus inventor
named Satoshi Nakamoto shared a white paper
describing a new P2P non governmental monetary system,
pulling together technical and philosophical concepts developer
on the cypherpunks list.
Within a few years, the movement was reborn
whit a new generation committed to enhancing personal
freedom and privacy with cryptographic tools.
It's like discovering an oasis when
you're lost in the desert.
It's bitcoin that's singlehandedly responsible for
the current wave of cypherpunk activity.
It's always messier that visionaries can anticipate
because reality is bigger than anyone had.
We're still on the road in the quest to
build architectures that amplify human freedoms and protect
us from the dynamics in the other direction.
